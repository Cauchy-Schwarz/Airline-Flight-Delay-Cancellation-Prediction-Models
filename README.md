# Airline-Flight-Delay-Cancellation-Prediction-Models
• Built and compared multiple models to predict airline flight delays and cancellations using NumPy, Pandas, SciPy and other python-based libraries via Jupyter.
• Implemented from scratch a Multilayer Perceptron model with two hidden layers and a sigmoid function. Created two logistic regression models using gradient ascent and descent with sigmoid functions. Developed a K-Nearest Neighbor model with an Euclidean distance and a Naive Bayes Classifier.
• Effectively compared model performance, revealing the Naive Bayes model to be 7% more accurate and 9 times faster than others
